# e-katanalotis-data

A set of Python scripts to scrape supermarket products, categories and price information from the Greek Government's e-Katanalotis price comparison website https://e-katanalotis.gov.gr

Sample output is included in the form of JSON files (the product/category file is a complete list, scraped on Nov 23 2022).

The website is built using Ember.JS and Highcharts, making it possible to access the whole dataset via Javascript, and using a Selenium headless browser.
